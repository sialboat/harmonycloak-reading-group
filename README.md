# harmony-cloak-reading-group
Slides, notes, and resources relevant to my reading group on the my reading group presentation.

## About HarmonyCloak
[HarmonyCloak](https://mosis.eecs.utk.edu/harmonycloak.html) is a paper
published by the [MOSIS](https://mosis.eecs.utk.edu/) lab from the
University of Tennesee, Knoxville's department of Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science. It details an adversarial noise injection attack that 
prevents Generative Audio models from learning off of a given piece of
music (MIDI or Audio).

## Usage
The notes, slides, and drawings used in the talk are provided in this 
GitHub repository. Feel free to use them as reference at any point in time.

The raw source files are written in [Typst](https://typst.app), a modern
typesetting language. You can use Typst in VSCode using the 
[Tinymist VSCode Extension](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist/tree/a90cd25a8793f438d5fd58829fbb812d2e5c8fc6/editors/vscode/).

`harmonycloak-slides.typ` is the raw source for the Slides that have been 
presented. There are some comments within this file that did not find a
place in both the notes and slideshow that may be of some use.
`harmonycloak-notes.typ` is the raw source for the Notes that I took on 
the research paper. 

Both the slides and notes above have an associated `.pdf` export for more convenient viewing.

The `Images` folder contains all of the images (screenshot from internet or
HarmonyCloak) pulled to be used in this presentation. **I do not own the 
rights to any of the images provided**.

The `Excalidraw Drawings` folder contains the two Excalidraw Drawings used 
in the presentation for simpler visualization. Additionally, there are two
`.pdf` exports for more convenient viewing. [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) 
is a free drawing program that can be accessed online, as an app,
or as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Plugin.
